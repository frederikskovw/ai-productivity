STRONG Method: Oren Klaff's "Pitch Anything" introduced the STRONG Method, which stands for Setting the Frame, Telling the Story, Revealing the Intrigue, Offering the Prize, Nailing the Hookpoint, and Getting a Decision. The purpose of this framework is to gain control and attract interest during a pitch or negotiation, making it especially useful for high-stakes pitches.

Duarte's Presentation Form: From Nancy Duarte's book "Resonate", this form involves creating a strong contrast between "what is" and "what could be", building suspense, showing the consequences, presenting the solution, and a call to action. It is designed to resonate with the audience on an emotional level, making it suitable for presentations that aim to inspire or move people to action.

The Hero's Journey: This is a narrative framework developed by Joseph Campbell in his work "The Hero with a Thousand Faces". It positions your audience (or a character they empathize with) as a hero who encounters a problem, faces challenges, overcomes them, and returns transformed. This versatile framework is used to create engaging, transformative narratives.

Problem-Solution-Benefit: This straightforward framework is common in sales and marketing. It involves introducing a problem that resonates with the audience, presenting a solution (your product/service/idea), and outlining the benefits. The purpose is to persuade the audience to adopt the proposed solution.

STAR Method: The STAR Method, standing for Situation, Task, Action, Result, is originally designed for behavioral interview responses but is also useful in presenting case studies or success stories. The method involves describing a situation, the task required, the action taken, and the resulting outcome. It's particularly useful when you need to demonstrate a track record of success or explain the process of achieving a result in a clear and compelling way.

5-Step Story Structure: This is a fundamental narrative structure that's been used in storytelling for thousands of years, and it's often applied in both fictional and non-fictional contexts. The five steps are: Setup (introducing the characters, setting, and initial situation), Confrontation (presenting a problem or challenge), Rising Action (the attempts to resolve the problem), Climax (the turning point, often involving a major decision or discovery), and Resolution (the conclusion and aftermath). The purpose of this structure is to create a compelling narrative that takes the audience on an emotional journey, making it suitable for both informative and persuasive presentations.
