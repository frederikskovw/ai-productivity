Nature of the Presentation: What is the topic or main idea of your presentation? Are you presenting a concept, data, product, case study, or something else? Describe the subject matter or theme of your story. For instance, if your presentation is about launching a new product, say so. If it's about conveying research findings or a case study, be explicit about it. You should mention the key point or goal of the presentation.
Emotional Connection: How much emotional engagement do you expect from your audience? Are you aiming to inspire or provoke strong emotions, or is the presentation more informational? Describe the kind of emotional response you're hoping to evoke in your audience. If you're aiming to inspire, provoke thought, motivate action, or simply inform, mention it. If there are particular emotions related to your story (like joy, surprise, fear, etc.), name them.
Complexity of the Idea: How complex is the idea or information you're presenting? Is it simple and easy to grasp, or does it involve intricate details or concepts that require thorough explanation? Here, explain how intricate your story or the idea you're presenting is. If your story involves complex processes, intricate details or abstract concepts, mention that. On the other hand, if it's a simple, straightforward story or concept, say so.
Level of Novelty: Is the idea or product being presented a novel concept, or is it something the audience is likely to be familiar with? Explain whether your story or idea is new or known to the audience. If you're introducing a brand-new concept, product, or idea, state it. Conversely, if your idea or topic is something the audience is already familiar with, make sure to mention this.
Presence of Data: Does your presentation involve a lot of data or require evidence-based arguments? Specify whether your story will include data, statistics, or evidence-based arguments. If you're presenting lots of data or using evidence to make your case, be clear about that. If your story doesn't involve data, state this.
